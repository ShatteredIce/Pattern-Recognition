Project 12 - Shape Recognition

Our goal is to be able to identify shapes in an image.
Currently, our program is able to load an image and process some data for the image.

Usability Test:
Type filenames into the textfield and click 'load'.
Click on 'calculate' to display the shape data.

Working files:
square.png
rect4.png
triangle1.png
triangle7.png
