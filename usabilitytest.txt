Project 12 - Shape Recognition

The goal of this project is to be able to identify shapes in an image.
Currently, the program is able to load an image and process some data for the image.

Usability Test:
Run the program.
Type filenames into the textfield and click 'load'.
Click on 'calculate' to display the shape data.

Working files:
square.png
rect.png
triangle1.png
triangle7.png (broken by new algorithm)
triangle8.png
decagon.png (broken by new algorithm)
